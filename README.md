# Billy Walton's Arch Linux environment installation

Welcome to the installation script that sets up my Arch Linux environment the way I want it using Hyprland as the window manager.

Please note, that this script is only meant to be used by the owner.  I am not responsible for any damage this script causes if you run this on your own machine.

This script is meant to be run on a machine that is being logged into by a sudo user after a fresh installation of the minimal Arch Linux setup.

The following are installed via this script:

1.  Hyprland
2.  SDDM (With the Sugar Candy Theme) - Login Manager
2.  kitty (Terminal)
3.  Chromium (Web Browser)
4.  Nautilus (File Manager)
5.  Gnome Text Editor
6.  Visual Studio Code

The following additional tools are installed:
1.  vim (TTY text editor)
2   fastfetch (I have configured .bashrc to use this to display system information when launching a terminal)
2.  git
4.  less (used by git)
5.  man-db (used by man)
